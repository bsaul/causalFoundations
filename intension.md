# Intensions of Formalizing Causal Foundations {X} {Y}

In recent years,
causal inference is emerging
from interdisciplinary origins
into its own academic discpline
Despite its growth and popularity,
work remains to be done to formalize its the foundations.

The Causal Foundations {X} {Y} aims to:

* foster collegial discussions that may be brain melting
but where there is joy in the inquiry;
* establish a forum
for the study of the foundations of causal inference,
drawing insights
from the fields of logic, math, statistics, and computer science;
* translate and publish our foundations into one or more
formally verified (machine checked)
proof management systems[^1].

where:

* X ?= discussion, working, research
* Y ?= group, organization, collaboratory, forum
