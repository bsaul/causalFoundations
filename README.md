# Intentions of the Foundations Forum

The vision of the Foundations Forum is to
foster collegial discussions on the foundations of causality.
We aim to draw insights
from philosophy, mathematics, and science
in order to deepen our understanding of
causality and causal inference.

## Meetings

The Forum meets monthly on the third Friday at 2:30PM
somewhere in the greater Chapelboro metropolitan area.
